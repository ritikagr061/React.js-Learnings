**what is a component**
small reusable code that could be used later. example : header and footer can be component , as it could be used on multiple pages.

**what is single page application**
only single page is there and everything is there stored in the same page as components , So when we need to display lets say login page we simply load that component associated with login page.

**why React**
single page application
its flexible
Reusability thru components and properties
Strong and Big React community
